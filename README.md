# ECE444-F2023-Lab5 (Test-Driven Development)  

## Unit test in Project 1:
I set up the `web_app/tests` directory and the `views_test.py` file, then wrote the **`test_home()`** function (in `/web_app/tests/views_test.py`). 

## Pros and Cons of TDD:  

### Pros of Test-Driven Development (TDD):  

  - **Higher Code Quality**: TDD encourages developers to write tests before writing the actual code. This results in code that is well-tested and less prone to bugs, leading to higher overall code quality.

  - **Improved Design**: TDD promotes a modular and loosely coupled design. Developers focus on the interface and behavior of a component before implementation, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.

  - **Rapid Feedback**: TDD provides rapid feedback on code changes. When a test fails, developers can quickly identify and fix the issue, reducing debugging time.

  - **Regression Testing**: TDD ensures that existing functionality remains intact when new features are added or modifications are made. This reduces the risk of introducing regressions.

  - **Documentation**: Test cases serve as documentation for how the code should behave. This is especially valuable for other developers who work on the codebase.

### Cons of Test-Driven Development (TDD):  

  - **Initial Learning Curve**: TDD may have a steep learning curve for developers who are new to the practice. Writing tests before code can be challenging to grasp initially.

  - **Time-Consuming**: Writing tests before implementation can slow down the initial development process. Developers need to invest time in writing test cases.

  - **Overhead**: TDD introduces some overhead in terms of maintaining test suites. When requirements change, tests may need to be updated accordingly.

  - **Not a Universal Solution**: TDD does not guarantee bug-free code. While it can catch many issues, it cannot cover all possible scenarios or human errors.

  - **Resistance to Change**: Teams or organizations with established workflows may face resistance when trying to adopt TDD practices, as it requires a shift in mindset and practices.
